# Extracting Numerical Information From Text For Building Graph

This code is designed to extract specific numerical information from text data and store it in variables. Subsequently, the extracted data is utilized to create various types of graphs for visualization purposes.

### Examples:

Here are some examples of the types of graphs that can be generated using the extracted information:
- Line Graphs: The code can be used to create line graphs that display trends and patterns over time or epochs.
- Scatter Plots: Scatter plots can be generated to visualize relationships and correlations between different data points.
- Bar Charts: Data extracted from text can be used to create bar charts to compare values of different categories.
- Histograms: Information can be used to construct histograms for exploring the distribution of data.
- Pie Charts: Pie charts can be created to represent data proportions and percentages.

## Requirements

To use this code, you will need the following:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to use the code:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file: `NumericalInformationExtractor.ipynb`.

3. Copy and paste your data into the file named: `dummy_data.txt`. Make sure both files are in the same directory.

4. Execute the code in the Jupyter Notebook to extract and visualize numerical information from the text data.
